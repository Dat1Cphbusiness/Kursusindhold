# BankSystem - TurnbasedGame

The BankSystem java project is used to demonstrate, discuss and let students try-out multiple level 2 java programming techniques.
The project is developed over a 2 week period using both live-coding and pair programming, for which two sprint sheets (broken down assignments that the students code using pair programming ) has been developed.

Domainwise the project evolves from a bank administration system to a turnbased game template.

## Subjects (level2):


### In the main branch
- simple composition - a bank with a list of customers
- a textbased menu using the Scanner object
- separation of concers with a utility class for interacting with the user
- UML documentation (PlantUML) - class diagram, sequence diagram
- datapersistence using File and FileWriter to load customer data

### In the TurnbasedGame branch
- utility class for datapersistance code is added (FileIO)
- refactoring techniques: The program is repurposed to be used as boilerplate code for turnbased games
- working with git branches (strictly introductory level, trying it out - no theory)


#### General repetition of level 1 subjects
 - control flow
 - variable declaration, initialisation and scope.
 - working with lists and arrays
 - method declaration, logic, calling.
 - class construct, object instantiation, constructors, getters, toString




## Didactic use
  **Materials:** print out of sprint sheet 1 and 2. 1 copy for each pair in the class (class of 30, print 16) [url](https://github.com/Dat1Cphbusiness/Kursusindhold/blob/main/BankSystem/sprintsheets.pdf)
  
  **Groups:** Create teams of 4. Then subdivide teams into pairs.
  
  **Table arrangement:** place tables in squares(2x2). 
  

  **Progress**
1. In intelliJ clone project (New from version control). Name the project Turnbased game
2. Start a new branch.
3. hand out sprint sheet1
4. Code it in class
5. hand out sprint sheet2
6. Code it in class
